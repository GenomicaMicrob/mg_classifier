# Databases

You need to have the preformatted databases in a subdirectory named `databases/`

Available databases are:
### 16S
- SILVA ver. 128
- RDP ver. 11.5
### 18S
- Protista ver. 4.5

We recommend getting the [EzBioCloud](http://www.ezbiocloud.net/resources/pipelines) curated database, but since it is not publicly available (although it is free for academia), we cannot distributed it. If you get it, then youÂ´ll have to formatted accordingly. You can use our script [db_reformatter.sh](https://github.com/GenomicaMicrob/db_reformatter).
